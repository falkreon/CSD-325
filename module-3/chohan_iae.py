In this traditional Japanese dice game, two dice are rolled in a bamboo
cup by the dealer sitting on the floor. The player must guess if the
dice total to an even (cho) or odd (han) number.

Additionally, there is a house rule that if the dice add up to 2 or 7,
the player will get a 10 mon bonus.
